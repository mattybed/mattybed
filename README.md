# eBay Store Integration Example

This repository contains a simple Node.js website that fetches products from an eBay UK store using the eBay Finding API.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Set the following environment variables:
   - `EBAY_APP_ID` – your eBay App ID.
   - `EBAY_STORE` – the name of the eBay store to import products from.

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and display products from the configured store.
